# pyload
This is pretty much my first attempt of writing something, more or less, simple in Python. The abstract usage of different interfaces is impressive.

This simply downloads and executes an executable file directly from an url. 

Example usage: 

pyload.py https://www.yourhost.com/update.exe C:\Updates\update.exe
